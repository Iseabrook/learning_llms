The Green Finance Institute (GFI) has provided administrative support, and the TNFD Stewardship Council, which includes several governments and foundations, has provided leadership and financial support.",
  "The executive summary highlights the importance of nature and biodiversity for the prosperity and resilience of societies and economies. It emphasizes that nature is deteriorating globally and biodiversity is declining rapidly. The majority of ecosystem services that businesses and society rely on are in decline. The global economy is operating outside the safe zone for several critical processes. The table also mentions the risks posed to businesses, financial systems, and economies due to the inadequate pricing of ecosystem services. It discusses disruptions in global supply chains, threats to valuable commodities, impacts on market value and credit risk, and difficulties in meeting the demand for pollination services. The summary mentions the recognition of nature loss as a systemic risk by central banks and financial supervisors, and the encouragement for them to assess and act on economic and financial risks stemming from nature loss. It also highlights government mobilization through policy and fiscal action.",
  "The Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) has released recommendations to help companies and financial institutions incorporate nature into their decision-making processes. These recommendations provide a framework for identifying, assessing, managing, and disclosing nature-related issues. They are designed to be consistent with existing climate-related financial disclosures and international sustainability standards. The TNFD aims to encourage businesses to monitor, assess, and transparently disclose their risks, dependencies, and impacts on biodiversity. Despite the increasing recognition of climate and environmental risks, many companies and capital providers are unprepared and do not adequately account for nature in their strategies and capital allocation decisions. The TNFD recommendations aim to address this gap and highlight the importance of investing in the health and resilience of nature as a source of business opportunities and risk mitigation.",
  "The table and text discuss the application of materiality in jurisdictions worldwide and the recommendations of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD). Materiality is being applied through two lenses - meeting the information needs of capital providers and stakeholders focused on impacts. The TNFD recommendations aim to align with global policy goals and leverage the best available science. Nature-related risks and dependencies are now considered core and strategic risk management issues. The TNFD recommended disclosures include governance, strategy, risk & impact management, and metrics & targets.",
  "The recommended disclosures include descriptions of the board's oversight and management's role in assessing and managing nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities. It also includes information on the organization's human rights policies and engagement activities, as well as the identification and assessment of nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities. Additionally, the disclosures cover the effect of these factors on the organization's business model, value chain, strategy, and financial planning, as well as the resilience of the organization's strategy to nature-related risks and opportunities. The processes for identifying, assessing, and managing nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities in both direct operations and the value chain are also described. Furthermore, the disclosures include the metrics, targets, and goals used by the organization to assess and manage material nature-related risks and opportunities, as well as the locations of assets and activities that meet priority criteria.

The Taskforce aims to encourage early action and continuous improvement in addressing nature loss globally.",
  "The table provides an overview of the foundations for understanding nature and business as outlined by the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD). The TNFD has collaborated with scientific and conservation organizations to establish authoritative definitions for understanding nature. The main definitions are provided in the glossary. Nature refers to the natural world, including the diversity of living organisms and their interactions with each other and the environment. It is divided into four realms: land, ocean, freshwater, and atmosphere. Biodiversity refers to the variability among living organisms across these realms and is essential for productive and resilient ecosystems. Society, including individuals, corporations, and financial institutions, interacts with and depends on nature. Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities have significant interactions with nature.",
  "The Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) recognizes the importance of Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities in protecting ecosystems and biodiversity. Despite making up less than 5% of the world's population, they manage a significant portion of terrestrial landscapes and inland waters and have successfully protected 80% of global biodiversity. The TNFD has developed guidance on engaging with Indigenous Peoples, Local Communities, and affected stakeholders for assessing, managing, and disclosing nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities. The TNFD defines natural capital as the stock of renewable and non-renewable natural resources that provide benefits to people, including environmental assets such as forests, wetlands, coral reefs, and agricultural areas. Ecosystems, which are dynamic units of plant, animal, and microorganism communities, are organized into biomes defined by the type of plant life they support.",
  "The Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures recommends understanding corporate dependence on natural capital and ecosystem services for risk management. Ecosystem services can be categorized into provisioning, regulating and maintenance, and cultural services. These services contribute to economic and human activity and benefit businesses and wider society. The concept of nature, society, and the economy fitting together is illustrated in Figure 9.",
  "The table provides definitions for various concepts related to understanding nature.

The categories include policy risk, market risk, technology risk, reputational risk, and liability risk. Nature-related transition risks can be prompted by changes in regulation, policy, legal precedent, technology, investor sentiment, and consumer preferences.",
  "Nature-related systemic risks refer to risks that arise from the breakdown of an entire system rather than individual parts. These risks have the potential to cause sudden disruptions to societies, economies, and financial markets. Policymakers, market regulators, businesses, and financial institutions should consider these risks due to their unforeseen and significant financial implications. Liability risk, which includes potential financial losses from legal claims, may warrant separate consideration as it is associated with both transition and physical risks.",
  "The table provides a summary of nature-related risk categories, including physical risk, ecosystem stability risk, financial stability risk, transition risk, and systemic risks. It also mentions that sources of these risks can be systemic or non-systemic.
